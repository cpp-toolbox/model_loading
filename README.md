# model_loading
loads in obj files and their related data.

# missing textures
note that when a model is loaded in and the path to a file doesn't exist then we use the missing texture, thus you must always create the following file in your project
`assets/images/missing_texture.png`
![missing_texture](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a5cb36a4-5e04-4615-a5bc-dc0f8deb8d4e)
